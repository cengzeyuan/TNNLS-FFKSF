## Requirements
* PyTorch
* PyTorch Geometric >= 1.3.1  
* NetworkX
* tqdm  


Note that the versions of PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric should be compatible and PyTorch Geometric is related to other packages, which need to be installed in advance. It would be easy by following the [installation instruction](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html#).
